How do the brightness temepratures compares to the power spectrum (for different models)? 


	21cm Power vs Redshift:
at lower k there is a more defined cusp at redshift ~ 8
at higher k the cusp smoothes out into a dip

In order form least cusp behavior from most cusp behavior: oligarchic, democratic, fiducial  
democratic and fiducial models are more similar than compared to oligarchic 

For all the models, they generally capture that at low redshift the 21 power increases very faster but the power reaches a local max ~7 then dips or runs down a cusp at ~8 then continues to increase


	21cm Power vs k
at low redshift the 21cm power spectrum shifts down to smaller power 
at high redshift the 21cm power spectrum shifts up to higher power 

at low redshift 21cm power is more rough
at high redshift 21cm power is more smooth

oligarchic model breaks at low redshift (becomes unexpectedly linear) 

in all models the 21cm power increases with increasing k (or decreasing wavelength) 

k relates to observed wavelength (since 21cm wavelength from H1 "neutral H" is redshifted to higher waelengths)

	21cm Brightness Temperature contour maps at different redshifts
at low redshift the temperature is homogenous and very cold 0-10 mK
at high redshift the temperature is patchy and warm 25-35 mK

democratic has least (ionization, ionized H, HII) holes, fiducial has more and oligarchic has the most
