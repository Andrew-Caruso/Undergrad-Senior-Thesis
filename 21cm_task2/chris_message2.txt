Hey Andrew, sorry for the delay but I finally have the 21 cm fields on expanse for you, here: /expanse/lustre/scratch/ccain002/temp_project/for_andrew/21cm_fields/.    You should be able to access the files there even though they are in my scratch directory.  They are separated into folders for each model, and have the same redshifts as the 21 cm power spectra.  They are binary files with N = 300^3 32-bit floats.  You can unpack and reshape the data into cubes with
np.fromfile(filename,dtype=np.float32).reshape((N,N,N))
where N = 300.  The units will be in mK^2.  Then you can make visualizations of 2d slices of the data using imshow, contourf, or pcolormesh from the matplotlib.pyplot library.  The point of making these plots will be to build intuition for how visual features in the maps connect to the power spectrum - e.g. in maps with larger ionized bubbles you will notice larger power at small wavenumbers.
