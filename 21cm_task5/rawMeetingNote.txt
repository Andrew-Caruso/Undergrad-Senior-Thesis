quasar driven (more oligarchic) the three files (Not z=10)
fixed z look at k 
1 Gpc 
more cut (powers of 2) 
will be slow s 

lowest halo mass model (bright galaxies) = oligarchic 

doing worst case analysis 

21cm people want 95% accuracy 
aim: 25% from average 

could get exact k values use interpolate 
using:  scipy interp1d 
target k = 0.2 (lowest k that HERA has contraints, with best constraints) 
delta 21 ~ 500 
could find delta 21 ~ 100 (could be detected later) 

fix P vs K plots 
restrict y axis, get rid of drop off
want to see the peak (ionization bubble) 

new plot 
can divide total power by average to get error graph  
total power will be 1 across 


paper:
intro - 21 cm reionization (look at 21cm papers, like HERA), lead into what you will do (convergence, simulation, how big do box need to be to capture all power)  
methods/procedure - parameters of simulation, halo mass, models, and physical meaning of models, (driver of ionization). Mainly: what are models, how they are set up, meaning, and simulation box (1 Gpc, MPgadget?). Broad details. Describe wwhat you did to get the plots (not how you got the fields) 
results - (2 sections: 1. 300 Mpc box stuff (more z, models) and 2. 1 Gpc box 
conclusion 

focus on mostly intro and result

to do: 
introduction (akriv.org, 21cm reionization )
getting result
