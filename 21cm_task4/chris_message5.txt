Finals edits for task 4 P vs K program:

1. Change D^2(k) to mk^2 on y axis 

2. Change x axis to be k values 0.1 to 0.5 

Task 4 P vs Z program: 

1. Create the same plots but now at fixed k varying z (like previous part in task 4 but now vary z with fixed k instead of varying k with fixed z) 

2. Then move on to the final task (applying to the new data)
