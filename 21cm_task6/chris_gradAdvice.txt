Chris's grad school advice

good communication with advisor is very important 
if you do not communicate -> red flag for advisor
if your advisor does not communicate -> red flag for you

grad research is a marathon NOT a sprint
it is endurance.
Need to self-impose or agreed with advisor (if advisor wants to set reasonable hours) on hours of research work to do each week and day
Need to remain between these limits, such that you are not overworking or underworking and will continue to be productive (not burn out). 

NEED to set both upper and lower limits such that you are not overworking (which leads to burn out / becoming unable to be productive and not enjoying research) and you are not underworking (not getting work done)

research does not have fixed deadlines, because no one knows how long it will take. Sometimes need to say, lets start a paper or this is a deadend, try something else. 

Unlike undergraduate studies, which has deadlines, and is sprinting, grad school first year may be a sprint but after that it is purely research. You will need to pace your self with research. Do not overwork and do not underwork. 

If you really enjoy doing research stay in academia 
If you are okay or hate research, finish your phd and go into industry 
You need to really enjoy research to continue doing it 

If you feel the same when quarter ends "I really want this quarter to be over and start beak" in grad school, this is not a good sign because there are no breaks in research.
