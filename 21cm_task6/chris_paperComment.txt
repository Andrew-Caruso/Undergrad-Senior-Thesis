Hey Andrew, I left a few comments on your thesis - they are the text in bold font.  When you are done addressing them you can comment them out in the tex document (but don't entirely delete them).  One comment I'll make here is that when you are showing the 21 cm power spectra, you'll want to make use of sub-plots instead of having a separate figure for every model.  As an example, in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11266 I put different ionized fractions in different sub-panels and had several models on each panel.  Since your plots are more complicated than just one curve per model, I think instead you might want to put a different model in each panel, and perhaps have different rows be different versions of the plot (e.g. showing vs. wavenumber or vs. redshift)
