TASK 6: 
ISSUE:
The convergence error plots (ratio to the power in full box) does NOT converge to 1 as expected at greater distance or time. 
A potential cause of this issue may be due to the average density not being comparable to the cosmic average density (fixed value that can be found analytically)
This is because the previous tasks takes the full box, does the simulation on it, then chops it up into subvolumes and get their power spectra. 
Consequently, their average densities are above or below the cosmic average density.
In comparison to the paper that does a similar simulation. They took their full box, took a subvolume, then did their simulations on that subvolume. 
Due to time, we have to circumvent this issue, by selecting cuts that have average densities comparable to the cosmic average density. 

	1st subtask:
There are density field files, 1 for each full box (1 for the 1Gpc box and 1 for the 300 Mpc box)
The density field files are similar to the previous 21cm field files, except they are in units of the cosmic mean average density (value of 1)
Want to find the criterion to discard or keep certain densities (within some range of the cosmic average density) 
Using the desnity fields, perform the cuts and get the average densities to find the standard deviation. 
Therefore, average densities within c*std are kept (and their power spectra are found), while average densities outside this range are discarded. The constant value c will be adjusted to chose enough sub volumes to perform the analysis. The value for c may be 0.1 to 0.2, perhaps. 
Id est, for each subvolume with an average density within the average cosmic density +- the c*std are kept for the convergence analysis, else all subvolumes that fail to meet this condition are discarded and unused
Note that, this will need to be implemented into both the 300Mpc data and 1Gpc data

	2nd subtask:
Next will be to simply run the programs for both the 300Mpc and 1Gpc boxes, by selecting the subvolumes with average densities in the chosen range of the STD
and getting the convergence plots and error (ratio to total) plots 
NOTE that this may fail due to have too few cuts chosen or a incorrect chosen parameter c (for the range of valid densities). Thus, will likely need to do subtask 3, in which more subvolumes are generated.
	3rd subtask:
instead of cutting up the full box into subvolumes of fixed size.
Chose a box size and shift by the cell size or some factor times the cell size 
Do this for both the 1 Gpc box and 300 Mpc box.
Note that the 1Gpc box the full box is NOT equal to the number of cells 
but for the 300Mpc box the full box is equal to the number of cells
