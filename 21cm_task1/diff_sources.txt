democratic sources:
    same ionizing emissivity for all DM halos, independent of luminosity 
    At z=6, 50% ionizing emissivity from 1E9 M_sol/h to 1.8E9 M_sol/h (smaller)
    ionizing sources below current detectability 

Fiducial sources:
    ionizing emissivity scales with UV luminosity for each halo 
    At z=6, 50% ionizing emissivity from 1E9 M_sol/h to 1.8E10 M_sol/h (bigger)
    commonly used in simulation models 
    
Oligarchic sources 
    bright and massive sources "oligarchs" dominate reionization 
    At z=6, ionizing emissivity from 2E10 M_sol/h to ??? M_sol/h (very big) 
    ionizing sources mostly have been observed
