TASK 1: 
Hey Andrew, here are the 21 cm power results for the models I mentioned today - these are the power spectrum for the entire 300 Mpc/h volume for the democratic, fiducial, and oligarchic models described in the morphology paper.  You can unpack the tar files with
tar -xvf tarfilename.tar.gz
The power spectrum files themselves are text files with three columns - the second is the wave number k in h/Mpc, and the third is the 21 cm power, which has units of mK^2 (recall the 21 cm intensity is described in terms of a temperature).  Each folder has a whole bunch of files for different redshifts which are in the file names.  For now a good set of plots to make would be 21 cm power vs. k at several redshifts, and also 21 cm power vs. redshift at several fixed wave numbers (for the second you will find the scipy function interp1d to be quite helpful).  Later this week I'll put together a folder on Expanse for you with a more complete set of data, including the reionization histories for these models and the actual 21 cm brightness temperature fields.




NOTE:

For astronomers:
Flux or apparent brightness = power / area
Specific flux = flux / frequency = power / area / frequency 
Intensity = flux / solid angle = power / area / solid angle
Specific intensity = intensity / frequency = flux / solid angle / frequency 
		  = power / area / solid angle / frequency 
Brightness temperature = black body's temperature to produce same specific intensity as the source of interest 

For physicists:
Flux = projected field strength summed over an area 
Intensity = power / area 
Irradiance = flux / solid angle = power / area / solid angle

Black body = perfect emitter and absorber but zero reflection 
Grey body = imperfect emitter, absorber, and reflector
White body = perfect reflector but zero emitted or absorbed

Wave number = 2pi/wavelength
