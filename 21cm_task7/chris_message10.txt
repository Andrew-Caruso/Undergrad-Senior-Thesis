TASK 7 REVISED:

SUBTRASK 1: get 1Gpc/h contour maps (without density fields)   

SUBTASK 1: get 1Gpc/h plots
In order to acquire the multiplots for the 1 Gpc/h box, create cuts 100,200,300,400,500 (noting that the num cells is 1024). Also check that the 500 cut is working properly (appears to have std = 0, so likely it is chosing the same subvolume each time, therefore may need to adjust the step or soemthing). 

SUBTASK 2: Create violin plots  
Only do this for the 1Gpc/h box (NOT REPEAT NOT THE 300 mpc/h box!!) 
When making the violin plots, use the following for the guassian distribution):
	mean = abs(Pavg/Pmax -1)
	std = std of P / Pavg
where P is each power value (thus need to iterate through all)  

SUBTASK 3: Paper edits
Remove all 300 Mpc/h multiplots save for cut 150 (PvsK), cut 75 (PvsK) and cut 75 (PvsZ), with the latter showing the dependence on redshift importantly. 
There is no need for appedices in the paper and thus remove them.  
Also, no need to include density field plots. 

ADDENDUM 1:
stradivarius.py for the 300Mpc/h program was aborted and thus discarded
